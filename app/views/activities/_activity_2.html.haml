  %h4 Charging the System with Refrigerant
  %p Procedure:
  %ol
    %li Connect a refrigerant cylinder to center port E of the gauge manifold.
    %li Place the refrigerant cylinder on a platform scale, as shown.
    %li Open the refrigerant cylinder valve R, as shown.
    %li Crack the center hose E for a few seconds to purge the hose of air using an open wrench, as shown.
    %li Start compressor.
    %li Open the low side manifold hand valve.
    %h6 Note: Refrigerant is now flowing into the system.

    %li Continue charging until the weight reading of the scale corresponds to the initial reading less the required amount of refrigerant.
    %div
      Initial Reading   =   10 Kg.
    %div
      Actual Reading  =    7 Kg.
    %div
      Amount charge  =     3 Kg.

  %h4 Checking the Refrigerant Charge
  %h5 THREE METHODS
  %ul
    %li Head pressure method
    %li Slight glass method
    %li Leak detector method

  %p.bold Head Pressure Method
  %p.text-indent50 If head pressure indicates below normal of 10 psig, it is an indication of lack of refrigerant.

  %p.bold Sight Glass Method
  %p.text-indent50 Mount of sight glass in the liquid line and see if any bubbles are going up the line, as shown. Bubbles indicate insufficient refrigerant

  %p.bold Leak Detector Method
  %p.text-indent50 Leakage in the system also contributes to insufficient refrigerant.

  %br
  %h5 PROGRESS CHECK
  %p A. Choose the right answer in five (5) minutes.
  %ol
    %li Attached to the liquid line to help indicate refrigerant charge is sufficient or not.
    %ol{type: "a"}
      %li Pressure gage
      %li Sight glass
      %li Strainer

    %li Must be purge before charing a system with refrigerant.
    %ol{type: "a"}
      %li Air
      %li Oil
      %li Water

    %li Another indication that insufficient refrigerant is charged into the system.
    %ol{type: "a"}
      %li Smoke
      %li Liquid
      %li Bubbles

    %li Charging refrigerant in the system is done on the:
    %ol{type: "a"}
      %li High side
      %li Low side
      %li Condenser

    %li Evacuating the system can be done with the use of:
    %ol{type: "a"}
      %li Evaporator
      %li Condenser
      %li Vacuum pump
